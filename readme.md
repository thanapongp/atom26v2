## About Atom26

Atom26 is a website for 26th Atom Game (Tritharagames). The actual website is now offline.

The website was written using Laravel, jQuery and MySQL as main stack and was built with security, performance and usability in mind.

The website composed of many small systems, such as, memo system, scoreboard system, content management system.

## Why open-source this?

The reason why I decided to open-source this website is because the actual website is now offline, like I stated above, and to share my actual production code with people who might interest in hiring me.

## Can I see how it looks?

Yes, I've uploaded some screencaps into my [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_xvpv4tuIe3bnJlcG8yR3c2cjQ).
